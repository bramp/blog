I wondered if I could use Google&#8217;s [I&#8217;m Feeling Lucky][1] button just like bit.ly. I would pick a unique word and get it ranked #1 on Google. So I&#8217;m going to run a little experiment. The link <http://www.google.com/search?q=brampA2D&btnI> will do a search on Google and redirect to the #1 link. I&#8217;m picking the unique word **brampA2D** as it does not appear anywhere else online. Hopefully Google&#8217;s web crawlers will discover this post and the I&#8217;m Feeling Lucky link will start to automatically redirect here.

I imagine spammers could use this to mask their sites behind valid google.com links.
