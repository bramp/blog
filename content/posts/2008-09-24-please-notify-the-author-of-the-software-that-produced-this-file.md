While compiling my LaTeX document I received a message which made me chuckle:

<pre>**** This file had errors that were repaired or ignored.
   **** The file was produced by: 
   **** >>>> MicrosoftÂ® Office VisioÂ® 2007 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
   **** Please notify the author of the software that produced this
   **** file that it does not conform to Adobe's published PDF
   **** specification.
</pre>

This is printed because Visio is not embedding fonts which LaTeX needs.

So Microsoft, I hereby inform you that your software does not produce PDFs which conform to Adobe's specifications.

Until you fix your products I have to open and save the PDFs with Adobe Acrobat. This actually reduces the file size in most cases, so I might have done this anyway.
