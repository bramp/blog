In the various systems I&#8217;ve worked on, I have seen far too many terms to describe a phone number. I thought I&#8217;d catalogue them! <!--more-->

  * CTN &#8211; Customer Telephone Number
  * PTN &#8211; Personal Telephone Number
  * MTN &#8211; Mobile Telephone Number
  * number
  * phone
  * device / device_id
  * subscr_num &#8211; subscriber number
  * source\_addr / dest\_addr &#8211; As used by the [SMPP][1] spec
  * MSISDN &#8211; Mobile Subscriber ISDN Number / Mobile Station International ISDN Number(s) / Mobile International ISDN Number
  * MDN &#8211; Mobile Directory Number

any more?
