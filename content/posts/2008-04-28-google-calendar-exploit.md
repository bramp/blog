Whilst using Google Calendar I noticed an interesting feature, which Iâ€™m unsure if it should be there are not. Iâ€™ve contacted google twice about this bug but never received a reply. So I figured I would post about it here.

When creating a Google Calendar you may share the calendar with your friends and allow them to alter it. You do this by clicking â€œShare this calendarâ€ and then typing in their email address. I noticed something odd when I typed in a friendâ€™s Gmail address and clicked â€œAdd Personâ€. His name appeared next to the newly entered email address. I thought this might be because I previously spoke to this person via email, or he was a friend on GTalk. 

I asked around and collected a selection of address which I had never contacted or even seen before. I entered each one, and sure enough their ownerâ€™s names appeared! Then I tried to enter invalid Gmail addresses, and sure enough those were accepted, but did not display any name.

I think this is a very simple way to obtain information from a email address, and to even test if the email exists or not. Hopefully this isnâ€™t a feature and in fact Google made a mistake.
