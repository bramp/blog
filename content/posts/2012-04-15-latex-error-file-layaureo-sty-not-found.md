I was getting the error ``./cv.tex:11: LaTeX Error: File `layaureo.sty' not found.`` when trying to compile an [old tex document][1] of mine.

It seems layaureo is missing from [TexLive][2] 2009, the default on Debian at the moment (even though it&#8217;s 2012 now!). So I had to install TexLive 2011 from Debian Unstable using [Apt Pinning][3] to fix this problem.

Once TexLive 2011 is installed `apt-get install -t unstable texlive-lang-italian` to bring in the layaureo package.

I also encountered the following problems that was easier to resolve:

<pre>LaTeX Error: File `marvosym.sty' not found. solution: <code>apt-get install texlive-fonts-recommended</code>
LaTeX Error: File `fullpage.sty' not found. solution: <code>apt-get install texlive-latex-extra</code>
LaTeX Error: File `multibib.sty' not found. solution: <code>apt-get install texlive-bibtex-extra</code>
LaTeX Error: File `algorithm.sty' not found. solution: <code>apt-get install texlive-science</code></pre>
