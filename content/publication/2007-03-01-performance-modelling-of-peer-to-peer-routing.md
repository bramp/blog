> 
> We propose several models based on discrete-time Markov chains for the analysis of Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs). Specifically, we examine the Pastry routing protocol, as well as a Stealth DHT adaptation of Pastry to compute their exact expressions for average number of lookup hops. We show that our analytical models match with the protocols' simulation results almost perfectly, making them ideal for rapid evaluation.
