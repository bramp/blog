> **Abstract**
> 
> This paper presents a detailed characterisation of user behaviour for a series of interactive sport videos from the 2006 FIFA World Cup. In addition to generic VCR-like features, our custom-built Video-on-Demand architecture enabled us to provide advanced interactivity features such as bookmarking. We illustrate how such functionality may have a dramatic impact on how users consume content. A detailed discussion is also provided on how content distributors may turn this knowledge to their advantage, and thus increase the efficiency of their delivery networks.
