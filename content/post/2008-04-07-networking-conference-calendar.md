I was thinking about publishing but wanted to know the time frame for different conferences. So I spent a hour and compiled a list at Google Calendars. All the big names are on there, such as Infocom, Sigcomm, ACM Multimedia, CoNext, etc



Or the full page [HTML link][1], [iCal link][2], and [XML link][3].

I&#8217;m hoping that this will be of use to others, and that I will receive feedback on conference that I&#8217;ve missed.
