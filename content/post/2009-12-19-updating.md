Do people other than me find updating their servers to be relaxing? At every opportunity I run &#8220;apt-get update&#8221;. Today I&#8217;m updating 7 different machines simultaneously.

My Debian machines I simply issue the following commands:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
```

My FreeBSD machines:

```bash
portsnap fetch update
portmanager -u
```

I think the Debian process is easier (and clearly the fastest) but it obviously has to do less work because I&#8217;m downloading precompiled code. Portmanager is just as easy but seems to randomly ask me questions through the process whereas apt-get seems to get them out of the way early on. Either way I find this all very easy and relaxing&#8230; until I have to reboot the machines and find something is broken :/
