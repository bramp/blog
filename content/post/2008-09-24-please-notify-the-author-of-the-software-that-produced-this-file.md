While compiling my LaTeX document I received a message which made me chuckle:

```
**** This file had errors that were repaired or ignored.
**** The file was produced by: 
**** >>>> Microsoft® Office Visio® 2007 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
**** Please notify the author of the software that produced this
**** file that it does not conform to Adobe's published PDF
**** specification.
```

This is printed because Visio is not embedding fonts which LaTeX needs.

So Microsoft, I hereby inform you that your software does not produce PDFs which conform to Adobe's specifications.

Until you fix your products I have to open and save the PDFs with Adobe Acrobat. This actually reduces the file size in most cases, so I might have done this anyway.
