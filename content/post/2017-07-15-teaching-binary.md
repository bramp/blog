title: Teaching Binary to 8th Graders
---

This summer, as part of [GoogleServe](https://www.google.com/intl/en/giving/people.html#google-serve), I volunteered in a local school to teach kids about the importance of mathematics. This was part part of a larger program organised by the [Silicon Valley Education Foundation](svefoundation.org) (SVEF).  

I had 90 minutes, to introduce myself, talk a little about Google, and then spend the majority of the time teaching a topic of my choosing. Not knowing anything about teaching 8th graders I went to the Internet to find some material.

I quickly found [cse4k12.org](http://cse4k12.org), and the excellent [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/user/csunplugged) by [csunplugged.org](http://csunplugged.org). I decided I would teach about counting in binary. The [csunplugged videos](http://csunplugged.org/binary-numbers/) showed how to introduced this material in a way that seemed fun and got got the kids to work out the concepts on their own. I decided to mix the teaching with worksheets from [cse4k12.org](http://cse4k12.org) (to reinforce what the kids just learnt). Since I only had ~90 minutes to cover a lot, I took what I found on cse4k12.org and simplified their activities. I went ahead and created new worksheets, and am providing them here today for others to use. The rough schedule I used was:

* 10min Intro to counting in binary, with kids holding up [bits](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dCmZc3_v16eIqP230j0DyLXIsS2SVY1Ia8TmGo4b0vQ/edit?usp=sharing) (similar to [this video](https://youtu.be/Pz7dLWvi2w0)).
* 15min Work on this “[Counting In Binary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u3ITluIYx7K4x7yqy9101DB813TWI9_TYnUu8VxHBgs/edit#bookmark=id.rsbu3f59m3ry)” worksheet.

* 10min Representing text (again [similar to this video](https://youtu.be/xc0stfTVE_8))
* 15min Using “[Encoding Table](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u3ITluIYx7K4x7yqy9101DB813TWI9_TYnUu8VxHBgs/edit#bookmark=id.gpxpgtxg156z)” and “[Encoding Message](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u3ITluIYx7K4x7yqy9101DB813TWI9_TYnUu8VxHBgs/edit#bookmark=id.1r2yly29a01u)” worksheets to write some secret messages to each other.

* 10min Representing images with binary.
* 15min Using the “[Bitmaps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u3ITluIYx7K4x7yqy9101DB813TWI9_TYnUu8VxHBgs/edit#bookmark=id.1gznllvnujnk)” worksheets to encode their own images, and if time allows swapping encoded images with each other to decode.

All in all, this worked quite well. I learnt a lot, and was happy to see the class engaged! I will certainly be taking part in activities like this again.

P.S I found printing all sheets double sided worked really well. Oh and no computers needed! Put those laptops away.
