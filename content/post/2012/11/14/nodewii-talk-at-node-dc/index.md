Last night I gave a short talk at [NodeDC][1], on how to use Node.js with a wiimote. The offical title was &#8220;Controlling Node.js with a wiimote &#8211; My experiences with developing multi-threaded nodejs addon&#8221;. I&#8217;d like to thank the NodeDC guys for arranging everything last night, it was a great night, with some great talks.
