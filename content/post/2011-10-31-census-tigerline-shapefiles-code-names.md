I&#8217;ve been playing with the Tiger shapefiles to generate some interesting plots. While doing this I kept wondering what all the [different geographies][1] were. I couldn&#8217;t find a single concise list, so I made my own (but not yet complete) list from various source of information: 

| Code       | Description                                |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **cbsa**   | Metropolitan/Micropolitan Statistical Area |
| **bg**     | Block Group                                |
| **csa**    | Combined Statistical Area                  |
| **cd**     | Congress Districts                         |

| **county** | County                                     |
