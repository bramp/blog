## Update, I have now posted my final version [here][1]

Yesterday I finally finished my PhD thesis and submitted it to university house.

It is titled: &#8220;The Impact of Highly Interactive Workloads on Multimedia Systems&#8221;

If anyone is interested, you can [download a PDF copy][2], or if you are interested you can [look at my latex source code][3].

I&#8217;ve not finished my PhD yet, as I still have to pass my viva, and make any changes suggested. However, if people do find errors in my thesis now, I would be grateful if you [tell me][4].
