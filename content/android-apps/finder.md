description: Generic framework for building "store locator" style apps
---
This framework is able to display lists of specific locations, be it restaurant chains, coffee shops, offices, or anything else! These locations are stored in a local database, so no Internet connection is needed.

The framework supports the following features:

  * Self contained database of locations.
  * Sort locations by names or distance.
  * Display the 10 nearest locations in a list or on a map.
  * Display detailed information on a single location, i.e. Full Address, Phone Number.
  * Add the location to the phone&#8217;s address book.
  * Get directions to a specific location.

So far this framework is used by one application, [Nando&#8217;s Finder][1]. If you are interested in using this framework or have suggestions on what other apps I could make then please [contact me][2].

### Versions

  * 2010-01-08 &#8211; First Release

### TODO

  * Secure the database by compressing and encypting it ourself.
  * Automatic updates of CSV file.
  * Options dialog to set km or miles.
  * New LocationManager.
  * When in landscape make the button_list display in two columns.
  * Add support for easily changing database.
