      <description>&lt;p&gt;While trying to do a “do-release-upgrade”, to upgrade to &lt;a href=&#34;http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/&#34;&gt;Ubuntu Precise&lt;/a&gt;, I encountered a error that Google did not find a satisfactory answer for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;An unresolvable problem occurred while calculating the upgrade:
E:Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.

This can be caused by:
* Upgrading to a pre-release version of Ubuntu
* Running the current pre-release version of Ubuntu
* Unofficial software packages not provided by Ubuntu

If none of this applies, then please report this bug using the command &amp;#39;ubuntu-bug update-manager&amp;#39; in a terminal.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem was I had some packages installed that had no upgrade path, that is, are not available in Precise. To debug this I looked in the &lt;code&gt;/var/log/dist-upgrade/apt.log&lt;/code&gt; file, and it identifies the packages that were “broken”. I just had to “apt-get remove” them, do the release upgrade, and afterwards I could reinstall them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem solved.&lt;/p&gt;
