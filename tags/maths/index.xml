      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently watched the film &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480669/&#34;&gt;Timecrimes&lt;/a&gt;, which got me thinking about the theories of time travel. Now I&amp;#8217;m not a physics expert, but I have thought about these ideas for a while now and thought it was time to write them done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll try not to spoil the film if you haven&amp;#8217;t already seen it, but this discussion might give away too much. The general idea in the film was the main character Hector was chased into a time machine and was made to travel back a few hours in time. The film did a good job of explaining this to the viewer with the aid of a diagram and naming of the Hectors. I have reproduced their diagram and will use it for my discussion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Diagram of Hector time travelling&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hector 1 was being chased, and when he reached point A in time he entered the time machine and goes back. He is now at point B in time and is called Hector 2. Now the interesting thing in the film is that Hector 2 turns out to be the person chasing Hector 1 into the time machine! This is somewhat of paradox which I hopefully will explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hector 2 is convinced he needs to chase Hector 1 into the machine, and try to recreate events exactly as before, otherwise his existence will end. Now what would happen if Hector 2 decides not to chase Hector 1. Will Hector 2 disappear? I don&amp;#8217;t think so, because Hector 2 has to chase Hector 1 as it has already happened. I think this contradicts the multiple universes theory where every possible action that can happen, does happen. Here, the only thing that can happen for Hector 2 is to repeat exactly the events that Hector 1 experienced in his time frame. Without Hector 2 even knowing, he will be repeating exactly what he originally experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Hector 2 was able to decide not to chase Hector 1, then I think the order of events would have never happened, and Hector 1 would have never entered the time machine. So as soon as Hector 2 is created, he has no choice (or free will) to change the events that Hector 1 (his former self) experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing I find interesting here is how the chain of events happened in the first place, and this is where I have a theory. In mathematics many equations can be solved iteratively, and there are typically two outcomes. The equation converges to a solution, or the iterative process does not converge and quickly goes off to infinity. A fractal is a perfect example of this, as the colours of a fractal represent how many iterations it takes to solve the equation, or if it does not solve it is coloured black. This can be seen with the simple &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set&#34;&gt;Mandelbrot set&lt;/a&gt; fractal with equation Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = Z&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + c.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

        &lt;h4&gt;Taken from &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#39;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mandel_zoom_00_mandelbrot_set.jpg&amp;#39;&amp;gt;Wikipedia&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike Licence.&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#8217;m of the opinion that for Hector 2 to have gone back in time and influenced his own previous time line (ie Hector 1&amp;#8242;s), there must have been an iteration of events, which lead to a constant non-fluctuating time-line that Hector 2 chased Hector 1 into the machine. For example, without Hector 2 influencing Hector 1, there must have been a series of events that caused Hector 1 to enter the time machine. After he enters the time machine, events keep changing until we get to a constant state where Hector 2 chases Hector 1 into the machine, and each time round the iteration the exact same set of results occur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I realise the last paragraph completely contradicts my previous statement that Hector 2 was unable to change what was going to happen next in his time-line. This is obviously the paradox. However, I think once the order of events is in a steady state, the solution is solved and this is what happens. Until then, the time-lines can keep changing, until either a stead state is achieved, or it goes to infinity, in which case all the events never happened, and that branch of the multiple universe theory is not travelable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steady state may not be a single time-line where someone influences their previous time-line. It could be a iteration between two (or more) steady states. For example, lets use the Mandelbrot equation, and say that Z&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and we start with c = 1. The sequence of solutions is, 0, 1, 2, 5, 26, and keeps going to infinity. In time travel terms this could have never happened. However, let c = -0.5, we get a long sequence which eventually converges at ~-0.366. This is the kind of solution we observed in the film with Hector 1 and 2. As there are some starting events, which cause a sequence of time-lines to eventually converge where the previous iteration is the same as the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally lets imagine the situation where there are multiple solutions with a period. If we let c = -1 , then we get the sequence 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, etc. We can see this iteration has two solutions, 0, and -1, which flip between each other. Now, imagine this kind of solution happening with time travel. There are three players, Bob 1, 2 and 3. Bob 2 carries out a sequence of events that causes Bob 1 to turn into Bob 3. Now Bob 3 carries out a sequence of events that causes Bob 1 to turn into Bob 2. Therefore, depending on which iteration of events we are in, Bob 2, or Bob 3 is created from Bob 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One additional component in the film is that actually a third Hector is formed from Hector 2. Hector 3 played a minor part influencing Hector 2. Now this would be an equation in the form: Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = Z&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; + Z&lt;sub&gt;n-2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully my ideas of iteratively solving time travel makes sense, and I&amp;#8217;d appreciate any comments. As far as I know these are my own ideas, and I haven&amp;#8217;t previously read this anywhere. Also, as with most of my knowledge it has been collected from watching far too much Sci-fi :)&lt;/p&gt;
