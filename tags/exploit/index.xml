      <title>Google Calendar Exploit</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whilst using Google Calendar I noticed an interesting feature, which I&amp;rsquo;m unsure if it should be there are not. I&amp;rsquo;ve contacted google twice about this bug but never received a reply. So I figured I would post about it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating a Google Calendar you may share the calendar with your friends and allow them to alter it. You do this by clicking &amp;ldquo;Share this calendar&amp;rdquo; and then typing in their email address. I noticed something odd when I typed in a friend&amp;rsquo;s Gmail address and clicked &amp;ldquo;Add Person&amp;rdquo;. His name appeared next to the newly entered email address. I thought this might be because I previously spoke to this person via email, or he was a friend on GTalk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked around and collected a selection of address which I had never contacted or even seen before. I entered each one, and sure enough their owner&amp;rsquo;s names appeared! Then I tried to enter invalid Gmail addresses, and sure enough those were accepted, but did not display any name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a very simple way to obtain information from a email address, and to even test if the email exists or not. Hopefully this isn&amp;rsquo;t a feature and in fact Google made a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
